\section{Known Limitations}
\label{sec:Known_Limitations}

Users must take into account that COMPSs is an on-going project. The \textit{Workflows and Distributed Computing} group 
at the \textit{BSC-CNS} is doing its best to maintain and enhance COMPSs; granting all its users a better support in
each new COMPSs release. 

Consequently, COMPSs is beeing continously developed and has several on-going projects. We are aware that the current COMPSs version
(1.3) has some limitations and we are working to solve them as soon as possible. Next, we provide a list of the major known
limitations: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Exceptions:} \newline The current COMPSs version is not able to catch exceptions raised from a task.
 
 \item \textbf{Java tasks:} \newline Java tasks \textbf{must} be declared as \textbf{public}. Despite the fact that tasks can be
 defined in the main class or in other ones, we recommend to define the tasks in a separated class from the main method to force
 its public declaration.
 
 \item \textbf{Java objects:} \newline Objects used by tasks must follow the \textit{java beans} model (implementing an empty 
 constructor and getters and setters for each attribute) or implement the \textit{serializable} interface. This is due to the 
 fact that objects will be transfered to remote machines to execute the tasks.
 
 \item \textbf{Services types:} \newline The current COMPSs version only supports SOAP based services that implement the WS interoperability
 standard. Supporting Big Services is a feature we are \textbf{not} planning to implment in the near future.
 
 \item \textbf{NIO workspaces:} \newline The persistent workers implementation (NIO) has a unique \textit{Working Directory} per 
 worker. That means that tasks should not use hardcoded file names to avoid file colisions and tasks malfunction. We recommend to
 use files declared as task parameters, to manually create a sandbox inside each task execution and/or to generate temporary 
 random file names.
