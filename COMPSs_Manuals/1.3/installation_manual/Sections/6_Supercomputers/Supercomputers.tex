The COMPSs Framework can be installed in any SuperComputer by installing its packages as a normal distribution. The packages are
ready to be rellocated so the administrators can choose the right location for the COMPSs installation. \newline

However, if the administrators are not willing to install COMPSs through the packaging system, the COMPSs sources have a pre-build
script to deploy, compile and install COMPSs. For such a purpose, please execute the following commands:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
 # Check out the last COMPSs release
 me@localhost:~$ svn co http://compss.bsc.es/svn/releases/compss/latest/
 
 # Launch installation script
 me@localhost:~$ cd lastest/builders/
 me@localhost:~/lastest/builders$ ./buildSC <SC_username> 
                                            <SC_login_endpoint> 
                                            <SC_tmp_dir> 
                                            <SC_compss_installation_endpoint>
\end{lstlisting}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $<SC\_username>$ stands for your SuperComputer login username
 \item $<SC\_login\_endpoint>$ stands for the Supercomputer endpoint
 \item $<SC\_tmp\_dir>$ stands for a non-existent temporal folder (this folder will be \textbf{completely removed} at the end)
 \item $<SC\_compss\_installation\_endpoint>$ stands for the final COMPSs installation folder
\end{itemize}

~ \newline
For example, in the MareNostrum 3 case, administrators should execute:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
 me@localhost:~/lastest/builders$ ./buildSC bsc00000 
                                            mn1.bsc.es 
                                            /tmp/tmpCOMPSs 
                                            /gpfs/apps/COMPSs/
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that, if your machine has no preconfigured passwordless SSH connection to your $SC\_username@SC\_login\_endpoint$,
during the script execution you may be asked to introduce your password several times. 
\newline

Moreover, this script requires the local machine to have the following packages installed:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Maven
 \item Java 7 JDK
\end{itemize}

~ \newline
And the SuperComputer must have:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Autotools
 \item Java 7 JRE
 \item Automake
\end{itemize}
