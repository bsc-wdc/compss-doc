\section{C/C++ Sample applications}
\label{sec:CSampleApps}

The first two examples in this section are simple applications developed in COMPSs to easily illustrate how to code,
compile and run COMPSs applications. These applications are executed locally and show different ways to take advantge
of all the COMPSs features. 

The rest of the examples are more elaborated and consider the execution in a cloud platform where the VMs mount a common 
storage on \textbf{/sharedDisk} directory. This is useful in the case of applications that require working 
with big files, allowing to transfer data only once, at the beginning of the execution, and to enable 
the application to access the data directly during the rest of the execution.

The Virtual Machine available at our webpage (\url{http://compss.bsc.es/}) provides a development environment with
all the applications listed in the following sections. The codes of all the applications can be found under the 
$/home/compss/workspace\_c/$ folder.
