\section{Additional Configuration}
\label{sec:Additional_Configuration}


\subsection{Configure SSH passwordless}
By default, COMPSs uses SSH libraries for communication between nodes. Consequently, after COMPSs is installed on a set of machines,
the SSH keys must be configured on those machines so that COMPSs can establish passwordless connections between them. This requires
to install the OpenSSH package (if not present already) and follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Generate an SSH key pair
       \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
       \end{lstlisting}
 \item Distribute the public key to all the machines and configure it as authorized
       \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
          For every machine:
	  $ scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub machine:./myDSA.pub
	  $ ssh machine "cat ./myDSA.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; rm ./myDSA.pub"
       \end{lstlisting}
 \item Check that passwordless SSH connections are working fine
       \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
          For every machine:
	  $ ssh machine
       \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Configure the COMPSs Cloud Connectors}
This section provides information about the additional configuration needed for some Cloud Connectors.

\subsubsection{OCCI (Open Cloud Computing Interface) connector}
In order to execute a COMPSs application using cloud resources, the rOCCI (Ruby OCCI) connector has to be configured properly.
The connector uses the rOCCI CLI client (upper versions from 4.2.5) which has to be installed in the node where the COMPSs main
application runs. The client can be installed following the instructions detailed at
