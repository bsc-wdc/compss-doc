Addition
--------

The Addition application is a R application that performs several additions
by means of a task. The initial values are 8 and they are accumulated
two by two. Next, we provide the main code and the task declaration:

.. code-block:: r
      :caption: ``add.R``

      add <- function(x, y) {
         return(x + y)
      }


.. code-block:: r
      :caption: ``addition.R``

      library(RCOMPSs)
      source("add.R")
      compss_start()

      add.t <- task(add, "add.R", info_only = FALSE, return_value = TRUE)

      a <- 2; b <- 3;
      c <- 4; d <- 5;
      e <- 6; f <- 7;
      g <- 8; h <- 9;

      # Task (1) a + b
      ab <- add.t(a, b)
      # Task (2) c + d
      cd <- add.t(c, d)
      # Task (3) e + f
      ef <- add.t(e, f)
      # Task (4) g + h
      gh <- add.t(g, h)

      # Task (5) ab + cd
      abcd <- add.t(ab, cd)
      # Task (6) ef + gh
      efgh <- add.t(ef, gh)

      # Task (7) abcd + efgh
      result <- add.t(abcd, efgh)

      # Retrieve the result
      result <- compss_wait_on(result)
      cat("The result is:", result, "\n")

      compss_stop()


This code uses the ``add`` function described in the ``add.R`` file to add:
  - ``a`` and ``b`` into ``ab``
  - ``c`` and ``d`` into ``cd``
  - ``e`` and ``f`` into ``ef``
  - ``g`` and ``h`` into ``gh``
Then adds these partial results:
  - ``ab`` and ``cd`` into ``abcd``
  - ``ef`` and ``gh`` into ``efgh``
And finally adds these partial results to achieve the final result:
  - ``abcd`` and ``efgh`` into ``result``

On a normal R execution, each addition will be done after the other
(sequentially), accumulating the computational time.
RCOMPSs is able to parallelize this code thanks to its ``task``
decorator which wraps the ``add`` function instantiating the
``add.t`` function, and synchronize the results with the
``compss_wait_on`` API call.

The Addition application can be executed by invoking the ``runcompss`` command
with the application file name and the ``--lang=r`` flag.

The following lines provide an example of its execution.

.. code-block:: console

    $ runcompss --lang=r addition.R

The task dependency graph is depicted in the next figure.
It shows the parallelism that COMPSs has extracted and taken advantage of.

     The dependency graph of the addition application

COMPSs has detected that the addition of ``a+b`` and ``c+d`` is independent,
and consequently, that they can be done in parallel. While the addition
of ``res1+res2`` waits for the previous additions.
