===============

The PyCOMPSs player (``pycompss-player``) provides a tool to use PyCOMPSs within
local machines interactively through docker containers. This tool has been
implemented on top of the `PyCOMPSs programming model <http://compss.bsc.es>`__,
and it is being developed by the `Workflows and Distributed Computing
group <https://github.com/bsc-wdc>`__ of the `Barcelona Supercomputing
Center <https://www.bsc.es/>`__, and can be easily downloaded and installed
from the Pypi repository.
