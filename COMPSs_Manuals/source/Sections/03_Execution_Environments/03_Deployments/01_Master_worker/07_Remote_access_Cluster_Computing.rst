GOS - Remote Access to Computing Servers and Clusters
=====================================================

This section is intended to walk you through the COMPSs execution environment
that allow users to execute a COMPSs application using several remote machines
and computing clusters from a local machine. This access to remote resources is
done through the SSH (Secure Shell) and SCP (Secure Copy) protocols which are
the most used protocols to establishing a secure, encrypted connection between
a client computer and a remote server within a cluster.

Although, this feature has been designed to work with resources that have a
job submission queue. It can also be used to work with any other type of
machine that can be accessed by an SSH connection.
