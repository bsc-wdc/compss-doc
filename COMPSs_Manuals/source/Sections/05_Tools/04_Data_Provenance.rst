Data Provenance
===============

In order to achieve *Reproducibility* and *Replicability* with your experiments
using COMPSs, the runtime includes the capacity of recording details of the
application's execution, also known as *Data Provenance*. This is currently
only supported for Python applications, while in the meantime we are working
to extend it to Java and C/C++, which are programming languages also supported by COMPSs.

When the provenance option is activated, the runtime records every access
to a file or directory in the application, as well as its direction (IN, 
OUT, INOUT). This information is later used to record the Data Provenance
of your workflow using the `RO-Crate standard <https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/>`_, and with the assistance of
the `ro-crate-py library <https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py>`_. RO-Crate is based on
JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data), is
much simpler than other standards and tools created to record Provenance, and
that is why it has become a de-facto standard in a number of communities. Using RO-Crate
to register the execution's information ensures
not only to register correctly the Provenance of a COMPSs application run, but
also compatibility with some existing portals that already embrace
RO-Crate as their core format for representing metadata, such as `WorkflowHub <https://workflowhub.eu/>`_.


Software dependencies
---------------------

Provenance generation in COMPSs depends on the `ro-crate-py library <https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py>`_,
thus, it must be installed before the provenance option can be used. Depending on the target system, different
options are available using ``pip``:

If the installation is in a laptop or machine you manage, you can use the command:

.. code-block:: console

    compss@bsc:~$ pip install rocrate

If you do not manage the target machine, you can install the library in your own user space using:

.. code-block:: console

    compss@bsc:~$ pip install rocrate --user

This would typically install the library in ``~/.local/`` . Another option is to specify the target directory with:

.. code-block:: console

    compss@bsc:~$ pip install -t install_path rocrate

Our implementation has been tested with ``ro-crate-py`` version ``0.6.1`` and earlier.


Previous needed information
---------------------------

There are certain pieces of information which must be included when registering the provenance of a workflow that
the COMPSs runtime cannot automatically infer, such as the authors of an application. For specifying all these
fields that are needed to generate an RO-Crate but cannot be automatically obtained, we have created a simple YAML
structure where the user can specify them. The user needs to provide a YAML file named
``ro-crate-info.yaml`` that follows the next template structure:

.. code-block:: yaml

    COMPSs Workflow Information:
      name: Name of your COMPSs application
      description: Detailed description of your COMPSs application
      license: Apache-2.0 #Provide better a URL, but these strings are accepted:
                      # https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/#supported-licenses
      files: [main_file.py, aux_file_1.py, aux_file_2.py] # List of application files
    Authors:
      - name: Author_1 Name
        e-mail: author_1@email.com
        orcid: https://orcid.org/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
        organisation_name: Institution_1 name
        ror: https://ror.org/XXXXXXXXX # Find them in ror.org
      - name: Author_2 Name
        e-mail: author2@email.com
        orcid: https://orcid.org/YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY
        organisation_name: Institution_2 name
        ror: https://ror.org/YYYYYYYYY # Find them in ror.org

.. TIP::

    If no YAML file is provided, the runtime will fail to generate provenance, and will automatically generate an
    ``ro-crate-info_TEMPLATE.yaml`` file that the user can edit to add their details.

As you can see, there are two main blocks in the YAML:

- **COMPSs Workflow Information:** Where details on the application are provided.

- **Authors:** Where authors' details are given.

More specifically, in the **COMPSs Workflow Information** section:

- The ``name`` and ``description`` fields are free text, where a long name and description of
  the application must be provided.

- The ``license`` field is preferred by providing an URL to the license, but a set of
  predefined strings is also supported, and can be found here:
  https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/#supported-licenses

- ``files`` is a list of all the source files of the application (typically all ``.py`` files). The files' order
  is not important, since the runtime will obtain the name of the main file from the application execution.

And in the **Authors** section:

- ``name``, ``e-mail`` and ``organisation_name`` are strings corresponding to the author's name, e-mail and their
  institution. This is free text, but the ``e-mail`` field must follow the ``user@domain.top`` format.

- ``orcid`` refers to the ORCID identifier of the author. The IDs can be found and created at https://orcid.org/

- ``ror`` refers to the Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifier for an institution.
  They can be found at http://ror.org/

.. TIP::

    It is very important that the list of ``files``, ``orcid`` and ``ror`` terms are correctly defined, since the
    runtime will only register information for the list of ``files`` defined, and the ``orcid`` and ``ror`` are
    used as unique identifiers in RO-Crate.

In the following lines, we provide a YAML example for an out-of-core Matrix Multiplication COMPSs application,
distributed with license Apache v2.0, with 2 source files, and authored by 3 persons from two different
institutions.

.. code-block:: yaml

    COMPSs Workflow Information:

      description: Hypermatrix size 2x2 blocks, block size 2x2 elements
      license: Apache-2.0 #Provide better a URL, but these strings are accepted:

Usage
-----

The way of activating the recording of Data Provenance with COMPSs is very simple.
One must only enable the ``-p`` or ``--provenance`` flag when using ``runcomps`` or
``enqueue_compss`` to run or submit a COMPSs application respectively.
As shown in the help option:
 
.. code-block:: console

    compss@bsc:~$ runcompss -h

    (...)
    --provenance, -p    Generate COMPSs workflow provenance data in RO-Crate format from YAML file. Automatically
                        activates -graph and -output_profile.
                        Default: false

.. WARNING::

    As stated in the help, provenance automatically activates both ``-graph`` and ``-output_profile`` options.
    Take into account that the graph image generation can take some extra seconds at the end of the execution of your
    application, therefore, adjust the ``--exec_time`` accordingly.


Result
------

Once the application has finished, a new sub-folder under the Working Directory
will be created with the name ``COMPSs_RO-Crate_[uuid]/``, which is also known as *crate*. The contents of the
folder include all the elements needed to reproduce a COMPSs execution, and
are:

- **Application Source Files:** As detailed by the user in the ``ro-crate-info.yaml`` file
  with the term ``files``,
  the main source file and all auxiliary files that the application needs (e.g.: ``.py``).

- **complete_graph.pdf:** The image of the workflow generated by the COMPSs runtime,
  as generated with the ``runcompss -g`` option.

- **App_Profile.json:** A set of statistics of the application run recorded by the
  COMPSs runtime, as if the ``runcompss --output_profile=<path>`` option was enabled.
  It includes, for each resource and method executed: number of executions of the
  specific method, and maximum, average and minimum run time.

- **compss_command_line_arguments.txt:** Stores the options passed by the command
  line when the application was submitted. This is very important for a COMPSs
  application, since it could potentially change the resulting workflow generated
  by the COMPSs runtime.

- **ro-crate-metadata.json:** The RO-Crate JSON main file describing the contents of
  this directory (crate) in the RO-Crate standard. You can find an example at the end of this Section.

.. WARNING::

    All previous file names (``complete_graph.pdf``, ``App_Profile.json`` and ``compss_command_line_arguments.txt``)
    are automatically used to generate new files when using the ``-p`` or ``--provenance`` option.
    Avoid using these file names among
    your own files to avoid unwanted overwritings. You can change the resulting ``App_Profile.json`` name by using
    the ``--output_profile=/path.to/file`` flag.


ro-crate-metadata.json example
------------------------------

In the RO-Crate specification, the root file containing the metadata referring to the crate created is named
``ro-crate-metadata.json``. In these lines we provide an example of an ro-crate-metadata.json file resulting from
a COMPSs application execution, specifically an out-of-core matrix multiplication example that includes matrices
``A`` and ``B`` as inputs in an ``inputs/`` sub-directory, and matrix ``C`` as the result of their multiplication.
For all the details on the fields provided in the JSON file, please refer to the
`RO-Crate standard Website <https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/>`_. Intuitively, if you search through
the JSON file you can find several fields:

- **creator:** List of authors, identified by their ORCID.

- **publisher:** Organisations of the authors.

- **hasPart in ./:** lists all the files and directories this workflow needs and generates, and also the ones
  included in the crate. The URIs point to the local machine where the application has been run, thus, tells
  the user where the inputs and outputs can be found (in this example, a BSC laptop).

- **matmul_directory.py:** Main file of the application, includes the ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` needed and generated
  by the workflow, and a reference to the generated workflow image in the ``image`` field.

- **version:** The COMPSs specific version and build used to run this application. In the example: ``2.10.rc2205``.
  This is a very important field to achieve reproducibility or replicability, since COMPSs features may vary their
  behaviour in different versions of the programming model runtime.

We encourage the reader to navigate through this ``ro-crate-metadata.json`` file example to get familiar with its
contents. Many of the fields are easily and directly understandable.
