YAML configuration file
-----------------------

There are certain pieces of information which must be included when registering the provenance of a workflow that
the COMPSs runtime cannot automatically infer, such as the authors of an application. For specifying all these
fields that are needed to generate an RO-Crate but cannot be automatically obtained, we have created a simple YAML
structure where the user can specify them. By default, a YAML file named ``ro-crate-info.yaml`` will be expected in the
working directory (i.e. where the application is going to be run), but a different YAML file can be used by specifying
it with ``--provenance=my_yaml_file.yaml`` when activating workflow provenance generation.
The YAML file must follow the next template structure (notice later that only one term is mandatory, some other terms
are commonly used, and the rest of terms are for special cases only):

.. code-block:: yaml

.. WARNING::

    If no YAML file is provided, the runtime will fail to generate provenance, and will automatically generate an
    ``ro-crate-info_TEMPLATE.yaml`` file that the user can edit to add their details.

As you can see, there are three main blocks in the YAML:

- **COMPSs Workflow Information:** where details on the application are provided.

- **Authors:** where authors' details are given.

- **Agent:** the single person running the workflow in the computing resources.

COMPSs Workflow Information section
===================================

More specifically, in the **COMPSs Workflow Information** section, the most commonly used terms are:

- The ``name`` and ``description`` fields are free text, where a long name and long description of
  the application can be provided.

- ``sources`` can be a single directory or file, or a list of directories or files where application source
  files can be found. The ``sources`` term here is used not only to describe files with source code (typically all
  ``.py`` files for Python applications, or ``.java``, ``.class``, ``.jar`` files for Java ones), but also any
  installation and configuration scripts, compilation scripts (Makefile, pom.xml, ...), submission scripts, readme
  files, ... that should be included with the application package. Our script
  will add ALL files (i.e. not only source files, but any file found) and sub-directories inside each of the directory
  paths specified. The sub-directories structure is respected
  when the files are added in the crate (inside a sub-directory ``application_sources/``). Both
  relative and absolute paths can be used. If the term ``sources`` is not specified, only the application's main file
  will be added as the corresponding source code if it can be found in the current working directory.

- The ``license`` field is preferred to be specified by providing an URL to the license, but a set of
  predefined strings are also supported, and can be found at the `SPDX License list site <https://spdx.org/licenses/>`_.

- ``data_persistence`` value is ``False`` by default. It is a boolean to indicate whether the workflow provenance
  generation should copy the workflow's input and output datasets to the crate (i.e. must be set to ``True``).
  Including the datasets is feasible for workflows where they are small enough to be sent back and forth between
  execution environments. When datasets are too large to be moved around (i.e. hundreds of MB), this field should be set
  to ``False``.

- ``trace_persistence`` value is ``False`` by default. Whenever a Paraver trace is generated when running an experiment
  (see Section :ref:`Sections/05_Tools/03_Tracing/01_Apps_tracing:Activate Tracing`), the metadata of the resulting trace will be automatically
  added to the crate. As with datasets, the user can decide if the trace files themselves must be physically added, or
  include only references to where they can be located. If trace files are included, a directory named ``trace/`` will
  be available from the root path of the crate.

- ``software`` is used to manually describe the list of software dependencies (i.e. ``softwareRequirements`` in RO-Crate
  specification) this application
  has in order to be executed correctly. If the application requires certain packages / libraries / tools, they should be declared
  in this section. With this information recorded, metadata consumers will be able to react and install / load automatically
  these dependencies whenever a re-execution of the application is intended.

      - ``name`` is the full name of the external software used.
      - ``version`` can be a canonical version only (i.e. ``3.2.1``), or a much larger description (text).
        This should commonly include the output of ``tool --version`` command.
      - ``url`` where the software can be found.

From all these terms described, only ``name`` is  mandatory, since the rest are not strictly required to generate workflow provenance with COMPSs.
However, it is important to include as much information as possible in order to correctly share your application and
results. Besides, missing information can lead to reduced features when using workflow provenance (e.g. if no ``Authors``
are specified, WorkflowHub will not allow to generate a DOI for the workflow execution).

.. TIP::

    It is very important that the ``sources`` term is correctly defined, since the
    runtime will only register information for the list of source files defined under this term.

.. TIP::
    Large datasets (i.e. hundreds of MBs) should be uploaded to public
    data repositories (e.g. `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_ up to 50 GB per dataset, `FigShare <https://figshare.com/>`_
    up to 5 TB per dataset) and included as ``https`` references with the ``inputs`` or ``outputs`` terms.

.. WARNING::

    When ``data_persistence`` is True, application datasets will be stored in a ``dataset/`` sub-directory in the resulting
    crate. The sub-folder structure will be build starting at the largest possible common path among files (e.g. if ``/path_1/inputs/A/A.txt``
    and ``/path_1/inputs/B/B.txt`` are used, they will be located at ``dataset/inputs/A/A.txt`` and ``dataset/inputs/B/B.txt``
    respectively. However, if ``/path_1/inputs/A/A.txt`` and ``/path_2/inputs/B/B.txt`` are used, the location will be
    ``dataset/A.txt`` and ``dataset/B.txt``, since files do not share a common path and are considered to be at different
    locations.

Also, some more optional terms are available, but less commonly used:

- ``inputs`` to manually include input parameters (files or directories) to the application, in addition to the ones
  detected. In order to include very large files in the crate without actually copying them, files from remote
  repositories can be referenced (e.g. ``https://zenodo.org/records/10782431/files/lysozyme_datasets.zip``)

- ``outputs`` to manually include output parameters (files or directories) to the application, in addition to the ones
  detected. In order to include very large files in the crate without actually copying them, files from remote
  repositories can be referenced (e.g. ``https://zenodo.org/records/10783183/files/results_2003_0521_boumardes_BS.tar.gz``)

- ``sources_main_file`` is an advanced feature very rarely used, to override the detected main file for the application.
  It defines the name of the main source file of the application, and may be specified if the user wants to select
  a particular file as such. The COMPSs runtime detects automatically the main source of an application, therefore, this is a way
  to override the detected file. The file can be specified with a relative path inside one of the
  directories listed in ``sources``. An absolute path can also be used.

.. WARNING::

    The term ``sources_main_file`` can only be used when ``sources`` is defined. While the runtime is able to detect
    automatically the main file from application execution, this would enable to modify the automatic selection in case
    of need.

Authors section
===============

In the **Authors** section (the whole section is optional), a single author or a list of authors can be provided. They
describe the individuals that wrote the source code of the application. For each Author:

- ``name``, ``e-mail`` and ``organisation_name`` are strings corresponding to the author's name, e-mail and their
  institution. They are free text, but the ``e-mail`` field must follow the ``user@domain.top`` format.

- ``orcid`` refers to the ORCID identifier of the author. The IDs can be found and created at https://orcid.org/

- ``ror`` refers to the Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifier for an institution.
  They can be found at http://ror.org/

.. WARNING::

    If no ``orcid`` is found online or specified for an Author, they will not be listed as such. Their corresponding
    Organization information will only be included if the Organization's ``ror`` is found online or specified directly
    in the YAML configuration file.

.. TIP::

    It is very important that the ``orcid`` and ``ror`` terms are correctly defined, since they are
    used as unique identifiers for Persons and Organizations in the RO-Crate specification. The ``orcid`` id is the
    minimum information needed to be able to add a person as an Author.

Agent section
=============

The **Agent** section has the same terms as the Authors section, but it specifically provides the details of the sole
person running the workflow, that can be different from the Authors. The whole section is optional and only a single
individual can be provided.

.. WARNING::

    If no Agent section is provided, the first Author will be considered by default as the agent executing the
    workflow.

Automatic search of Authors and Agent
=====================================

When applications have a large list of authors, having to search for all the details of each one of them can be a
tedious task. For such cases, we have implemented an automatic search of details of **Authors** and **Agent** through the
ORCID and ROR public APIs. The main requirement of this feature is that the machine from which you run the experiment
must have the possibility of opening external connections (i.e. this can be an issue at some clusters, that restrict
their outbound communications for security reasons).

The following example shows that at least the ``name`` or ``orcid`` of the person needs to be provided so the search
can be triggered and the missing pieces of information will be looked for. Any extra information provided by the user
will override the information found online, as will be shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: yaml

    COMPSs Workflow Information:
      name: COMPSs Matrix Multiplication, out-of-core using files
      description: Hypermatrix size 2x2 blocks, block size 2x2 elements

    Agent:
      name: Rosa M Badia
      e-mail: Rosa.M.Badia@upc.edu
      ror: https://ror.org/03mb6wj31

Analyzing the example, we can see that at least the ``name`` or the ``orcid`` is provided in all the cases. Besides,
we can complete or override any details found online. For ``Raül Sirvent``, the automatic search will return ``Barcelona
Supercomputing Center`` as organization, but since the term ``organisation_name`` is specified, it overrides the search
result with ``Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya``. For ``Francesc Lordan`` we override his organization using the ROR.
Finally, in ``Raül Sirvent`` and ``Rosa M Badia`` we complete the ``e-mail`` information, that cannot be obtained online.

The provenance generation will print in the standard output the searches, and the results of each search, as shown in
the following lines:

When the search is successful, and some update happens in any of the persons referenced (i.e. when a non-existing field
is added), a new ``GENERATED_[your_YAML].yaml`` file is produced. This newly generated file can be used in future runs
of the experiment, either to avoid searching again for all the details of the Authors and Agent, or because the
machine does not have outbound connectivity, so all details need to be added in advance. An example of an automatically

In the following lines, we provide a YAML example for an out-of-core Matrix Multiplication PyCOMPSs application,
distributed with license Apache v2.0, with two source files, and authored by two persons from two different
institutions. Since no ``Agent`` is defined, the first author is considered as such by default. The ``data_persistence``
term is set to ``True``, to indicate the datasets should be included in the resulting crate.

Also, another example of a COMPSs Java K-means application, where the usage of ``sources`` including directories can be seen.
We add to the crate the sub-directories that contain the ``.jar`` and ``.java`` files. In this case,
an ``Agent`` is provided which is different from the person that wrote the application. The term ``data_persistence``
has been explicitly specified, but since the default value is ``False`` if not specified, it could be removed and still
obtain the same result. Finally, the ``trace_persistence`` term is set to True, indicating that, if traces are generated
when running this experiment, they will be included in the crate.

An example of the **minimal YAML** that needs to be defined in order to publish your workflow in WorkflowHub is:

.. code-block:: yaml

    COMPSs Workflow Information:
      name: COMPSs K-means

.. TIP::

    While effectively the only mandatory field to be able to publish a workflow in WorkflowHub is ``name`` inside the **COMPSs
    Workflow Information** section, we encourage application owners to include all the fields detailed in the YAML in
    order to get all the benefits of recording workflow provenance. For instance, if no authors are included, it will
    not be possible to generate a DOI for the workflow.
