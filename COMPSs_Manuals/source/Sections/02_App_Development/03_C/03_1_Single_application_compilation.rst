The user command "**compss_build_app**" compiles both master and
worker for a single architecture (e.g.Â x86-64, armhf, etc). Thus,
whether you want to run your application in Intel based machine or ARM
based machine, this command is the tool you need.

When the target is the native architecture, the command to execute is
very simple;

.. code-block:: console

    $~/matmul_objects> compss_build_app Matmul
