Application Compilation
-----------------------

.. include:: 02_1_Application_compilation_inc.rst

If you are using an IDE (such as Eclipse or NetBeans) we recommend you
to add the *compss-engine.jar* file as an external file to the project.
The *compss-engine.jar* file is available at your current COMPSs
installation under the following path: ``/opt/COMPSs/Runtime/compss-engine.jar``

*Please notice that if you have performed a custom installation, the
location of the package can be different.*
