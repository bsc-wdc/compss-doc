        .. TIP::

            For macOS, we **strongly recommend** to use the `Homebrew package manager <https://brew.sh/>`_, since it includes
            the majority of dependencies needed. In other package managers, such as MacPorts, quite some dependencies
            may be missing as packages, which will force you to have to install them from their source codes.
