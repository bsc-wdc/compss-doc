*************************************


This section provides a comprehensive guide to utilizing COMPSs, structured into 7 distinct tutorials.

It begins with an introduction to the framework and expands to cover programming with Python (PyCOMPSs),
as well as integration with Java and C++.
Further sections explore advanced features, execution environments ranging from local machines to
high-performance computing systems, hands-on experience with supercomputers, and finally,
using Dislib for distributed machine learning applications.
