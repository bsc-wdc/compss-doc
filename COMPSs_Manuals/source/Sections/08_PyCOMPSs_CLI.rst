===============

The PyCOMPSs CLI (``pycompss-cli``) provides a standalone tool to use PyCOMPSs
interactively within docker environments, local machines and remote clusters.
This tool has been implemented on top of the `PyCOMPSs programming model <http://compss.bsc.es>`__,
and it is being developed by the `Workflows and Distributed Computing
group <https://github.com/bsc-wdc>`__ of the `Barcelona Supercomputing
Center <https://www.bsc.es/>`__, and can be easily downloaded and installed
from the PyPI repository.
