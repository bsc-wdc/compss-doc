\subsection{Prerequisites}
\label{subsec:pip_prerequisites}
In order to be able to install COMPSs and PyCOMPSs with Pip the following requirements must be met:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Have all the dependencies (excluding the COMPSs packages) mentioned in the section \ref{subsec:packages_dependencies} satisfied. For example, the dependency \verb|graphviz|
 must be satisfied, while the dependency \verb|compss-runtime| can be ignored
 \item Have a proper JAVA\_HOME environment variable defined. As a reminder, this variable must contain a valid path to a JDK (not JRE)
 \item Have PIP installed. PIP can be installed via the \verb|python-pip| package.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Installation}
\label{subsec:pip_installation}


...the following command:\\
\verb|sudo -E python -m pip install pycompss -v|\\
\\
It is recommended to restart the user session once the installation process has finished. An alternative is to type the following command:\\
\verb|source /etc/profile.d/compss.sh|\\
However, this command must be executed in every different terminal.

The steps mentioned at the section \ref{sec:Additional_Configuration} must be done in order to have a functional COMPSs and pyCOMPSs installation.
