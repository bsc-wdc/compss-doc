\section{Tracing}
\label{sec:tracing}

COMPSs Runtime has a built-in instrumentation system to generate post-execution tracefiles of the applications' execution. The tracefiles contain different events representing the COMPSs master state, the tasks' execution state, and the data transfers (transfers' information is only available when using NIO adaptor), and are useful for both visual and numerical performance analysis and diagnosis. The instrumentation process essentially intercepts and logs different events, so it adds overhead to the execution time of the application.


The tracing system uses Extrae to generate tracefiles of the execution that, in turn, can be visualized with Paraver. Both tools are developed and maintained by the Performance Tools team of the BSC and are available on its web page 
\url{http://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/performance-tools}. 


For each worker node and the master, Extrae keeps track of the events in an intermediate format file (with \textit{.mpit} extension). At the end of the execution, all intermediate files are gathered and merged with Extrae's \textit{mpi2prv} command in order to create the final tracefile, a Paraver format file (.prv). See the visualization section \ref{sec:Visualization} of this manual for further information about the Paraver tool.


When instrumentation is activated, Extrae outputs several messages corresponding to the tracing initialization, intermediate files' creation, and
the merging process. 


At present time, COMPSs tracing features two execution modes:


\begin{description}
\item [Basic,] aimed at COMPSs applications developers
\item [Advanced,] for COMPSs developers and users with access to its source code or custom installations
\end{description}


Next sections describe the information provided by each mode and how to use them.


\subsection{Basic Mode}

This mode is aimed at COMPSs' apps users and developers. It instruments computing threads and some management resources providing information about tasks' executions, 
data transfers, and hardware counters if PAPI is available (see PAPI counters appendix \ref{sec:papi} for more info). 

\subsubsection{Usage}

In order to activate basic tracing one needs to provide one of the following arguments to the execution command:

\begin{itemize}
 \item -t
 \item -{}-tracing
 \item -{}-tracing=basic
 \item -{}-tracing=true
\end{itemize}


\noindent Examples given:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
runcompss --tracing application_name application_args
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:basic_trace} was generated as follows:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
runcompss \
     --lang=java \
     --tracing \
     --classpath=/path/to/jar/kmeans.jar \
     kmeans.KMeans
\end{lstlisting}

When tracing is activated, Extrae generates additional output to help the user ensure that instrumentation is turned on and working without issues. On basic mode this is the output users should see when tracing is working correctly:

\end{lstlisting}

It contains diverse information about the tracing, for example, Extrae version used (VERSION will be replaced by the actual number during executions), the XML configuration file used (extrae\_basic.xml), the amount of 
threads instrumented (objects through 1.1.1 to 1.2.5), available hardware counters ( PAPI\_TOT\_INS (0x80000032) ... PAPI\_L3\_TCM (0x80000008) ) or the name 
of the generated tracefile (./trace/kmeans.Kmeans\_compss\_trace\_1460456106.prv). When using NIO communications adaptor with debug activated, the log of each worker
also contains the Extrae initialization information.

\textbf{N.B.} when using python, COMPSs needs to perform an extra merging step in order to add the python-produced events to the main tracefile. If python events are not shown, check \textit{runtime.log} file and search for the following expected output of this merging process to find possible errors:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]

\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Instrumented Threads}


Basic traces instrument the following threads:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Master node (3 threads)
 \begin {itemize}
 \item COMPSs runtime
 \item Task Dispatcher
 \item Access Processor
 \end{itemize}
 \item Worker node (1 + Computing Units)
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Main thread
  \item Number of threads available for computing
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Information Available}

The basic mode tracefiles contain three kinds of information:

\begin{description}
 \item [Events,] marking diverse situations such as the runtime start, tasks' execution or synchronization points.
 \item [Communications,] showing the transfers and requests of the parameters needed by COMPSs tasks.
 \item [Hardware counters,] of the execution obtained with Performance API (see PAPI counters appendix \ref{sec:papi})
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Trace Example}

Figure \ref{fig:basic_trace} is a tracefile generated by the execution of a k-means clustering algorithm. Each timeline contains information of a 
different resource, and each event's name is on the legend. Depending on the number of computing threads specified for each worker, the number of timelines varies. 
However the following threads are always shown:



\begin{description}
 \item [Master - Thread 1.1.1, ] \hfill \\ this timeline shows the actions performed by the main thread of the COMPSs application
 \item [Task Dispatcher - Thread 1.1.2,] \hfill \\ shows information about the state and scheduling of the tasks to be executed.
 \item [Access Processor - Thread 1.1.3,] \hfill \\  all the events related to the tasks' parameters management, such as dependencies or transfers are shown in this thread.
 \item [Worker X Master - Thread 1.X.1,] \hfill \\ this thread is the master of each worker and handles the computing resources and transfers.  Is is repeated for each available resource. All data events of the worker, such as requests, transfers and receives are marked on this timeline (when using the appropriate configurations).
 \item [Worker X Computing Unit Y - Thread 1.X.Y] \hfill \\ shows the actual tasks execution information and  is repeated as many times as computing threads has the worker X
\end{description}

\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

\subsection{Advanced Mode}
This mode is for more advanced COMPSs' users and developers who want to customize further the information provided by the tracing or need rawer information like pthreads calls or Java garbage collection. With it, every single thread created during the execution is traced.
\\
\\
\textbf{N.B.:} The extra information provided by the advanced mode is only available on the workers when using NIO adaptor.


\subsubsection{Usage}

In order to activate the advanced tracing add the following option to the execution:

\begin{itemize}
 \item -{}-tracing=advanced
\end{itemize}

\noindent Examples given:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
runcompss --tracing=advanced application_name application_args
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:advanced_trace} was generated as follows:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
runcompss \
     --lang=java \
     --tracing=advanced \
     --classpath=/path/to/jar/kmeans.jar \
     kmeans.KMeans
\end{lstlisting}


When advanced tracing is activated, the configuration file reported on the output is \textit{extrae\_advanced.xml}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
*** RUNNING JAVA APPLICATION KMEANS
...
...
...
Welcome to Extrae VERSION
Extrae: Parsing the configuration file (/opt/COMPSs/Runtime/scripts/user/../../configuration/xml/tracing/extrae_advanced.xml) begins
\end{lstlisting}

This is the default file used for advanced tracing. However, advanced users can modify it in order to customize the information provided by Extrae. The configuration file is read first by the master on the \textit{runcompss} script. When using NIO adaptor for communication, the configuration file is also read when each worker is started (on \textit{persistent\_worker.sh} or \textit{persistent\_worker\_starter.sh} depending on the execution environment).

If the default file is modified, the changes always affect the master, and also the workers when using NIO. Modifying the scripts which turn on the master and the workers is possible to achieve different instrumentations for master/workers. However, not all Extrae available XML configurations work with COMPSs,
some of them can make the runtime or workers crash so modify them at your discretion and risk. More information about instrumentation XML configurations
on Extrae User Guide at: 
\url{https://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/performance-tools/trace-generation/extrae/extrae-user-guide}.


\subsubsection{Instrumented Threads}

Advanced mode instruments all the pthreads created during the application execution. It contains all the threads shown on basic traces plus extra ones used to
call command-line commands, I/O streams managers and all actions which create a new process. Due to the temporal nature of many of this threads, they may contain little information or appear just at specific parts of the execution pipeline.

\subsubsection{Information Available}

The advanced mode tracefiles contain the same information as the basic ones:


\begin{description}
 \item [Events,] marking diverse situations such as the runtime start, tasks' execution or synchronization points.
 \item [Communications,] showing the transfers and requests of the parameters needed by COMPSs tasks.
 \item [Hardware counters,] of the execution obtained with Performance API (see PAPI counters appendix \ref{sec:papi})
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Trace Example}

Figure \ref{fig:advanced_trace} shows the total completed instructions for a sample program executed with the advanced tracing mode. Note that the thread - resource correspondence described on the basic trace example is no longer static and thus cannot be inferred. Nonetheless, they can be found thanks to the named events shown in other configurations such as \textit{compss\_runtime.cfg}.

\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

\end{center}


\subsection{Custom Installation and Configuration}


\subsubsection{Custom Extrae}

COMPSs uses the environment variable EXTRAE\_HOME to get the reference to its installation directory (by default: \textit{/opt/COMPSs/Dependencies/extrae} ). However, if the variable is already defined once the runtime is started, COMPSs will not override it. User can take advantage of this fact in order to use custom extrae installations. Just set the EXTRAE\_HOME to the directory where your custom package is and make sure that it is also set for the worker's environment. 
\\
\\
Be aware that using different extrae packages can break the runtime and executions so change it at your own risk.

\subsubsection{Custom Configuration file}

COMPSs offers the possibility to specify an extrae custom configuration file in order to harness all the tracing capabilities further tailoring which information about the execution is displayed. To do so just pass the file as an execution parameter as follows:
    
\begin{itemize}
 \item -{}-extrae\_config\_file=/path/to/config/file.xml
\end{itemize}

The configuration file must be in a shared disk between all COMPSs workers because a file's copy is not distributed among them, just the path to that file.
