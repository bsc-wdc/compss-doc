%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% APPLICATION GRAPH %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Application graph}
At the end of the application execution a dependency graph can be generated representing the order of execution of each type of 
task and their dependencies. To allow the final graph generation the \texttt{-g} flag has to be passed to the \texttt{runcompss} command; the graph file is written in the \texttt{base\_log\_folder/monitor/complete\_graph.dot} at the end of the execution.

Figure \ref{fig:complete_graph} shows a dependency graph example of a \textit{SparseLU} java application. The graph can be
visualized by running the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
compss@bsc:~$ gengraph ~/.COMPSs/sparseLU.arrays.SparseLU_01/monitor/complete_graph.dot
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MONITOR %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{COMPSs Monitor}
\label{subsec:monitor}
The COMPSs Framework includes a Web graphical interface that can be used to monitor the execution of COMPSs applications. COMPSs Monitor is installed as a service and can be easily managed by running any of the following
commands:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
compss@bsc:~$ /etc/init.d/compss-monitor usage
Usage: compss-monitor {start | stop | reload | restart | try-restart | force-reload | status}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Service configuration}
The COMPSs Monitor service can be configured by editing the \texttt{/opt/COMPSs/Tools/}
\texttt{monitor/apache-tomcat/conf/compss-monitor.conf}
file which contains one line per property:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{\textbf{COMPSS\_MONITOR}} Default directory to retrieve monitored applications (defaults to the \texttt{.COMPSs} folder inside the \texttt{root} user).
 \item \texttt{\textbf{COMPSs\_MONITOR\_PORT}} Port where to run the compss-monitor web service (defaults to 8080).
 \item \texttt{\textbf{COMPSs\_MONITOR\_TIMEOUT}} Web page timeout between browser and server (defaults to 20s).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Usage}
In order to use the COMPSs Monitor users need to start the service as shown in Figure \ref{fig:monitor_start}.
\begin{figure}[thb!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Sections/4_Tools/Figures/monitor_start.jpeg}
    \caption{COMPSs Monitor start command}
    \label{fig:monitor_start}
\end{figure}

And use a web browser to open the specific URL:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
compss@bsc:~$ firefox http://localhost:8080/compss-monitor &
\end{lstlisting}

The COMPSs Monitor allows to monitor applications from different users and thus, users need to first login to access their applications. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:monitoring_interface}, the users can select any of their executed or running COMPSs applications and display it.
\begin{figure}[thb!]

    \caption{COMPSs monitoring interface}
    \label{fig:monitoring_interface}
\end{figure}

~ \newline

To enable \textbf{all} the COMPSs Monitor features, applications must run the \texttt{runcompss} command with the \texttt{-m} flag. This flag 
allows the  COMPSs Runtime to store special information inside inside the \texttt{log\_base\_folder} under the \texttt{monitor} 
folder (see Figures \ref{fig:simple_exec_monitor} and \ref{fig:simple_logs_monitor}). Only advanced users should modify or delete any of these files. If the application that a user is trying to monitor 
has not been executed with this flag, some of the COMPSs Monitor features will be disabled.

\colorComment{\textbf{Attention}: To enable all the COMPSs Monitor features applications must run with the \texttt{-m} flag.}

The webpage also allows users to configure some performance parameters of the monitoring service by accessing the 
\textit{Configuration} button at the top-right corner of the web page.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% APPLICATION TRACING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Application tracing}
\label{sec:Tracing}

COMPSs Runtime can generate a post-execution trace of the execution of the application. This trace is useful for
performance analysis and diagnosis.

A trace file may contain different events to determine the COMPSs master state, the task execution state or the file-transfers.
The current release does not support file-transfers informations.

During the execution of the application, an XML file is created in the worker nodes to keep track of 
these events. At the end of the execution, all the XML files are merged to get a final trace file.

In this manual we only provide information about how to obtain a trace and about the available Paraver (the tool used to analyze the traces) configurations. For further
information about the application instrumentation or the trace visualization and configurations please check the \textit{COMPSs Tracing Manual} 
available at \url{http://compss.bsc.es} .

\subsubsection{Trace Command}


In order to obtain a post-execution trace file one of the following options \texttt{\textbf{-t}}, \texttt{\textbf{--tracing}}, \texttt{\textbf{--tracing=true}}, \texttt{\textbf{--tracing=basic}} 
must be added to the \texttt{runcompss} command. All this options activate the basic tracing mode; the advanced mode is activated with the 
option \texttt{\textbf{--tracing=advanced}}. For further information about advanced mode check the \textit{COMPSs Tracing Manual}. Next, we
provide an example of the command execution with the basic tracing option enabled for a java K-Means application.

\end{lstlisting}

At the end of the execution the trace will be stored inside the \texttt{trace} folder under the application log directory.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
compss@bsc:~$ cd .COMPSs/kmeans.Kmeans_01/trace/
compss@bsc:~$ ls -1
kmeans.Kmeans_compss_trace_1460456106.pcf
kmeans.Kmeans_compss_trace_1460456106.prv
kmeans.Kmeans_compss_trace_1460456106.row
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Trace visualization}
The traces generated by an application execution are ready to be visualized with \textit{Paraver}. \textit{Paraver} is a powerful 
tool developed by \textit{BSC} that allows users to show many views of the trace data by means of different configuration files.
Users can manually load, edit or create configuration files to obtain different trace data views.

If \textit{Paraver} is installed, issue the following command to visualize a given tracefile:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
compss@bsc:~$ wxparaver path/to/trace/trace_name.prv
\end{lstlisting}
