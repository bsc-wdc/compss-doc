\section{Other trace examples}
\label{sec:OtherExamples}

To end this section, letâ€™s present some other examples of COMPSs traces. COMPSs traces can be 
much complex as the number of workers or tasks grows. Just to illustrate this, the following 
pictures show traces with a greater number of workers and tasks.
